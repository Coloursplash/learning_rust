# Learning Rust

This repository is where I have been learning the Rust programming language. Feel free to look around!

Not only can this teach you some fundementals of Rust,but it can be a great revision guide if you forget something in the future.

## Notes

Rust uses snake case, not camel case, so all variables and projects will be styled as 'example_text'.

For loops are normally used over while loops because they have more safety and are more concise. Even for looping within a certain range, a range can be generated as an array such as `for i in (1..4) {code here}`.

## Cargo

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| cargo new example_project | Creates a new project in directory 'example_project' |
| cargo run | Runs the project listed in the current or parent directory |
| cargo build | Builds the project listed in the current or parent directory |
| cargo check | Checks whether the project listed in the current or parent directory can compile |
| cargo update | Update to latest version of all dependent packages |
